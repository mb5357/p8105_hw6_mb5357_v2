# p8105_hw6_mb5357_v2

I couldn't push my original homework 6 to git due to the cache files being extremely large. 
I went to office hours and unfortunately the issue couldn't be resolved.
The TA recommended I make a new repo and submit that. 
Hence, I made a new r project and committed & pushed everything except the cache files.
Here is the link to my original git repo: https://github.com/mb5357/p8105_hw6_mb5357
